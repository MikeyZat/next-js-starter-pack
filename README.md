# Welcome to Next.js starter pack!

> Hours of configuring your project before you can code anything useful - is it just me or everyone hates it? 

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20status-%20paused-orange">

## Motivation
The initial goal was to create a boilerplate which would help me and other developers to start their Next.js applications without the headache caused by configuring all the necessary things. As a React development-kit I choose [antd-design](https://ant.design/) - quite fresh and promising library. However, due to lack of time, the projects is still in progress and is **not** likely to be finished soon.

## What's included

 - [x] Next.js
 - [x] Typescript
 - [x] react-intl (support for multi-languages)
 - [x] Babel
 - [x] Eslint
 - [x] Prettier
 - [x] Custom webpack configuration (including useful aliases)
 - [x] Nodemon (hot reloading)
 - [x] antd-design
 - [x] Redux & redux-toolkit
 
## What should be added to the mix

- [ ] Good support for styles (working well with Next & antd)
- [ ] dockerfile
- [ ] General support for deploying the app
